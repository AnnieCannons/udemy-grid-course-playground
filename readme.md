# Udemy Grid Course Playground

This is a repo for you to code in as you work through the Udemy CSS Grid course.

You will _not_ be submitting this in any way, it is **just starting code so that you can code along with the course**.

You should work in `index.html` and `css/main.css`, but NOT in `css/base.css`, which is simply some styling CSS provided to you by the Udemy course instructor.
